**Past Project Progress:**

During the initial phases of the project, our primary objective has been to establish the foundational
components of the Student Grade Calculator application using Java Swing. Our focus has been on
creating the essential functionalities to achieve a "demonstration of project".

**Lokesh's Past Activities:**

**GradeCalculator.java:**

- Created initial GradeCalculator.java and written import statements.
- Developed the GUI interface for the application, incorporating input fields for course details
such as course name, credits, and grade.
- Working on basic functionalities for grade calculation for a single course, allowing users to
input grades and credits and calculating GPA accordingly.

**Katharyn's Past Activities:**

- Creation of Github Repository
- Creation of Proposal.md file
- Creation of initial java files in Github
▪ Grading
▪ .classpath
▪ .project

**Next Steps:**

Our immediate goal is to achieve the specified 50% completion threshold. To accomplish this
milestone, we have outlined the following steps:

- Improve the GUI interface to enhance user experience.
- Implement support for adding multiple courses and calculating overall GPA.
- Develop functionalities to analyze grades.
- Implement functionalities to export grade reports in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV) to enable
users to save and share their grade data.

**Difficulties:**

The project encountered challenges primarily related to GUI design that is designing an initial user-
friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was challenging and it was difficult to implement the GPA
calculation logic and managing project complexity.
